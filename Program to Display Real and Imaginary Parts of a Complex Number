# Datatypes- Program to Display Real and Imaginary Parts of a Complex Number

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, creates the complex number, and displays its real and imaginary components separately.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1.Start the program.

2.Read the real part of the complex number from the user.

3.Read the imaginary part of the complex number from the user.

4.Use the complex() function to create a complex number using the values taken as input.

5.Display the complex number.

6.Display the real part using the .real attribute.

7.Display the imaginary part using the .imag attribute.

8.End the program.

## 🧾 Program
a=int(input())

b=int(input())

x=complex(a,b)

print(x)

print(x.real)

print(x.imag)


## Output
<img width="482" height="312" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cbddab0-8a51-4d06-891c-ffe06a00a590" />
